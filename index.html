                <p>
                    Rammeverk is a framework to frame in works of video-game arts and display them to the public in their true form.
                </p>
                <h2>The treachery of non-interactive media</h2>
                <p>
                    After going to a couple local video-games-are-art exhibitions and watching some videos of how 
                    theese kinds of exhibitions are done internationally, there is one thing that disappoints me.
                    And thats the way video-games are displayed to the public.</p><p>While Retro-games have great display-opportunities by using their original displays such as arcade-cabinets
                    and consoles connected to old-fashioned TVs, there is a huge gap when it comes to newer games, PC-games,
                    mobile-games and especially web-games. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Games that are originally played with a keyboard and mouse, generally does not get the same experience as the other games.
                    The few times they are attempted to be displayed, the display is poorly structured with just a computer slapped together,
                    or a laptop where the fans are heard more than the game itself. The immersion is ruined because the player starts focusing
                    on how poorly the displays are set up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even the display to arcade and console-games are threatened now after the pandemic, since there will be stricter rules in place
                    to what the public is allowed to touch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we will be left with then is the "do not touch"-version of the displays, who practically consists of video and imagery of the games.
                </p>
                <h2>Phones - People have them.</h2>
                <p>
                    To bring interactivity to video, you need a controller. Publicly shared game-controllers are a thing of the past, but what is often forgotten,
                    is that most people have a controller in their pocket most of the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rammeverk intends to connect smartphones together with public displays to make users able to tap or scan the display to start using
                    their phone as the controller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount of control is almost infinite. Joysticks, buttons, touch-areas, gyro, compass.. all the sensors the phone has can be utilized
                    in the games.
                </p>
                <h2>Accessibility like never before.</h2>
                <p>
                    Different people have different playstyles. It doesnt matter whetever you play with both your hands, one-handed, with your eyes or your mouth.
                    With Rammeverk, you will be able to expand the system with custom controllers, or even adapters to connect to your day to day equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prefer to play together with someone else? Rammeverk will also support a co-player mode.
                </p>
                <h2>Personal audio.</h2>
                <p>
                    Do you hate the noisy enviroment of an arcade, and are scared of similiar scenes in the exihibtion? 
                    Rammeverk will stream the audio of the games directly to your phone so that people will can connect their own personal headset.
                    Get the full immersion with noise-cancelling headsets.
                </p>
                <h2>When will this be available?</h2>
                <p>
                    Rammeverk is in early development, but there is a proof-of-concept ready to go.
